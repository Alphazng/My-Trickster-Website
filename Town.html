            <p>Welcome to The New World, a fantastical realm where the seven elements intertwine and shape the world. <br> In ancient times, mortals were bestowed with extraordinary elemental powers by the Archons. <br>These abilities allowed them to transform the wild lands into a thriving homeland. <br> Nevertheless, the world underwent a dramatic upheaval 500 years ago, leading to the collapse of an ancient civilization.
                <br>While the calamity that befell the world has subsided, true peace remains elusive, and the quest for restoration continues.</p>
